# Snake
This is a simple application demonstrating the use of JFrame to create a copy of Snake, Snake was originally made using the arcade game Blockade as their original inspriation. Blockade was developed by a British company called Gremlin Interactive in 1976. The main difference between Blockade and Snake is that Blockade was a two player game where each individual would guide their own Snake at the same time attempting to get in the way of the other Snake while continuing to focus on gaining length (If Tron & Snake had a love child).
